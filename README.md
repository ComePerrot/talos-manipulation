# talos-manipulation

Set of tools to work on manipulation tasks with the robot Talos.

This repo is built around two packages:

- [deburring_mpc](./deburring-mpc/README.md): an implementation of a Model Predictive Controller based on Crocoddyl
- [deburring_ros_interface](./deburring-ros-interface/README.md): the interface to allow the use of the MPC within a ROS architecture

As well as some python examples (which can be found in pyTalos)
